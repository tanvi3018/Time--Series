Apple Stock Price Forecasting
Purpose

The Apple Stock Price Forecasting project aims to predict the future prices of Apple Inc.'s stock using various machine learning and time series forecasting techniques. By analyzing historical stock prices and other relevant financial indicators, the project seeks to build models that can forecast stock prices, helping investors and analysts make informed decisions. The primary goal is to achieve high accuracy in predicting future stock prices and identify trends in the stock market.
How to Run

To run the project, follow these steps:

    Clone the Repository:

    sh

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Apple_Stock_Price_Forecasting.git
cd Apple_Stock_Price_Forecasting

Install the Dependencies:
Ensure that you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or above). Install the necessary Python packages by running:

sh

pip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare the Data:
Make sure your dataset (historical stock prices and other indicators) is properly formatted and placed in the correct directory. If needed, modify the data_loader.py script to load and preprocess your data accordingly.

Run the Main Script:
Execute the main script to train and evaluate the forecasting models:

sh

    python apple_stock_price_forecasting/main.py

    View Results:
    The script will output the predicted stock prices along with evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and visualizations like the predicted vs. actual prices. These results will help you assess the accuracy of the forecasts.

Dependencies

The project depends on several Python libraries, which are listed in the requirements.txt file. Key dependencies include:

    pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, particularly for handling time series data.
    numpy: For numerical computations and array operations.
    scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
    tensorflow or pytorch (if using deep learning models): For building and training more complex forecasting models.
    matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing the results.
    seaborn: For creating more detailed visualizations.

To install these dependencies, use the following command:

sh

pip install -r requirements.txt
